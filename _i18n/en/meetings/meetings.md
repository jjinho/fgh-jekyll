<h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>

<h5>Lord’s Day Morning Worship Meeting</h5>

At the worship meeting, you will notice a table in the center with a loaf of 
bread and a cup of wine on it. These symbols are graphic emblems rich in meaning: 
the bread reminds us of a body of the Lord Jesus and the cup of His precious blood. 
Taken together they remind us of the vicarious death of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Following His command given at the upper room shortly before His death at Calvary,
we are *remembering Him (1st Corinthians 11:24)* in worship and communion by 
breaking the bread and drink the cup.

The cup reminds us of the communion of the blood of Christ and the bread of 
the communion of the body of Christ. Scripture tells us that forgiveness of sin 
is through His blood and that forgiven sinners become members of body of Christ. 
We have been *"called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord”
(1st Corinthians 1:9)*. In keeping with the New Testament pattern, brethren,
guided simply by the Spirit of God lead in worship until the bread and cup are 
distributed to those in the local fellowship. Hymns also are given out during 
the service by various brethren, as guided by the Holy Spirit.

For convenience, there will be an offering taken for the Lord’s work following 
the bread and wine. However visitors will not be solicited, nor will we take an 
offering from any person not in assembly fellowship. At the closing of worship, 
a devotional will be held in which a brother will read and comment upon a portion
of the Bible.

While all are cordially invited to observe the worship meeting, as the scripture 
teaches, sharing in the bread and cup is only for those who are in fellowship 
of the assembly or visiting from a similar local fellowship with a letter of 
commendation *(Romans 16:1,2; Acts 18:27)*. This is not an effort to discriminate 
nor to judge the salvation of visitors, but protects both the assembly and 
the visitor. This gives the visitor the opportunity to observe, and learn, 
the directions for the worship meeting, as given by God's Word.


<h5>Lord’s Day Ministry Meeting</h5>

Each Lord’s Day, a message from the Word of God is delivered to provide for the 
spiritual needs of the believers. Our conviction is that a good quality of life 
starts with having a proper relationship with God, through knowing His Son, 
Jesus Christ, as revealed in His Word, the Bible. The ministry of the Word 
gives spiritual food to believers through edification, encouragement, and
exhortation.


<h5>Lord's Day Gospel Meeting</h5>

All are welcome to hear the simple and plain preaching of the Gospel. Service 
runs for one hour, and there are no collections at this nor any other service. 
The biblical definition of “Gospel” is clearly stated as: *“For I delivered unto 
you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins 
according to the scriptures; And that He was buried and that He rose again the 
third day according to the scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3,4).* This meeting 
starts by opening in prayer and then singing a hymn. Normally there are two 
speakers who will each deliver a 30 minutes message. The grace, mercy, and love 
of God, and the great blessing of knowing sins forgiven and having eternal life
will be presented. The Bible is clear that there is only one means of salvation,
and that is through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of 
Calvary.



<h5>Lord's Day Sunday School</h5>

We welcome all children, of all ages to our Sunday School. Before Sunday School 
begins, the adults and children sing together. Afterwards the children attend 
classes with other children in their age group (toddlers/preschool, preteenagers, 
and teenagers/young adults). Every second Lord’s Day, a message is delivered 
to all the Sunday school children and adults.



<h5>Bible Reading (Lord's Day and Wednesdays)</h5>

The Bible Reading is where the Scriptures are systematically opened, outlined,
and discussed. We have two Bible Readings each week. Lord’s Day afternoon, we 
study a book in the New Testament and on Wednesday evenings we study a book in 
the Old Testament. We study the Bible for doctrinal instruction, practical
encouragement, and to deepen our interest in God’s Word.



<h3>Monthly Meetings</h3>

<h5>Youth Meeting</h5>

One Saturday every month, the young people gather together to study the Bible. 
Youths living in these perilous times need concrete teaching concerning faith, 
spiritual wisdom, discernment, and discipline from the Word of God. The meeting
is held to provide spiritual strength, vision, and encouragement during the 
three sessions of Bible study and fellowship. Lunch is also provided to all who
attend.



<h5>Childrens Meeting</h5>

One Saturday each month, we hold a meeting to let children hear of God's love
through the preaching of the Gospel, and to study God's Word. We also strive
to have the children learn and memorize Bible verses that are delivered during
the message that is preached. Lunch is also provided to all who attend, and in
the afternoon, a Bible quiz is held to stimulate and reinforce what they have
already learned.


<h3>Annual Meetings</h3>

<h5>Summer Ministry/Gospel Series and Summer Retreat</h5>

A four Day ministry series following a theme is conducted in July (from the 
Thursday of the third week of July till the following Lord’s Day) annually at
Flushing Gospel Hall. Immediately after this ministry series, a four day and
three night retreat (Monday to Thursday of the 4th week of July) is held at an
out of state retreat. (The location varies each year and is announced on our
bulletin board). During the conference a ministry series is held following the 
same theme as the ministry series.



<h5>Children's Summer Vacation Bible School (VBS)</h5>

Our Summer VBS is held during the Summer Retreat (Monday to Thursday of the 4th 
week of July). There is no fee for room and board, meals, and activities. 
During VBS, the Gospel is preached so that all the children might know the Lord
Jesus Christ and His finished work of Salvation. Bible lessons are also taught. 
Other activities include singing, praying, memorizing Bible verses, and spending
time playing sports and participating in other activities. On the final night 
all the adults and children spend time together around a camp fire.



<h5>Annual Year End Ministry Series</h5>

Every year in December we have a series of ministry meetings which is held every
evening from Christmas Day till December 31st, with the exception of Lord’s Day.
Dinner is served from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM and the meeting starts at 7:45 PM. All
are welcome.



<h5>Assembly Day and Sunday School Treat</h5>

On the last Lord’s Day the year, we gather to remember give thanks for the grace
and blessings that the Lord has shown to us the past year. All the believers in
fellowship as well as the Sunday School children gather together at Flushing
Gospel Hall at 3:00 PM. We reflect over all the events that have happened in the
past year and the Sunday School children present all the things that they have
learned. Awards are then given to the Sunday School children for their 
accomplishments, and we end the evening with dinner together.
